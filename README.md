⭕⭕\_____/⭕⭕🚘

A simple Java project that demonstrates the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It uses:

- Inheritance: It allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.
- Polymorphism: It involves the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
- Encapsulation: It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, primarily through method overriding and interfaces.

To practically implement these concepts, I have chosen the "Car Dealership" method, which handles customers by calculating the amount of money they have, and determines if they are able to buy the car of their choice or not.
